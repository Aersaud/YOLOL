# ST-Waypoint-System v1.0

- Features by default 38 customizable waypoints (expansion available until your ship has no space - virtually unlimited)
- Visual Waypoint Selection System - You can see the waypoint name and coordinates prior to parsing/confirming the waypoint for navigation since that is a more time consuming task.
- Save and Overwrite Visual - If you are trying to save a waypoint over an existing waypoint it will tell you it is overwriting the waypoint that is there. (Hint hint there may be an undo button and a confirmation to overwrite for this in a future release)
- Home Button takes you back to WP1, Up for Incrementing, Down for Decrementing, Save for saving.
- You can press and hold to move faster up or down waypoints. It will wrap when you reach the end or beginning.
- 2 Panels + 5 Buttons for the whole system to function within your cockpit.
