## Features
- 38 Name Customizable Waypoints (expansion available until your ship has no space - virtually unlimited)
- Visual Waypoint Selection System - You can see the waypoint name and coordinates prior to parsing/confirming the waypoint for navigation since that is a more time consuming task.
- Save and Overwrite Visual - The system will confirm the Save of waypoint on the WPStat screen. If you are overwriting a waypoint you will have 30 seconds (customizable) to confirm that you want to actually Overwrite the waypoint. Home Button = Cancel Overwrite, Save Button= Confirm and Overwrite
- Home Button takes you back to WP1, Up for Incrementing/Moving up your waypoints, Down for Decrementing/Moving down your waypoints, Save for saving.
- You can press and hold to move faster up or down waypoints. It will wrap when you reach the end or beginning.
- 2 Panels + 5 Buttons for the whole system to function within your cockpit.
- Waypoint Parsing is done on 3 lines total per axis (X,Y,Z). While you are loading a waypoint the selection button will turn red to indicate the loading system is now locked out. When loading/parsing is complete the button will automatically unclick itself and revert to the original green color.
- Fully compatible with Compass and SignaTrope. Make sure you select the correct version for your navigation/coordinate system from the 2 folders available here! The file name will signify the version you are looking. st_ means SignaTrope c_ means Compass
